# CS-210-CPlusPlus
Repository for CS-210 course where we were taught about C++ and how to integrate languages.

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is the first Project of the CS-210 course. We were asked 

# What did you do particularly well?

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
